CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (add_library):
  Target "image_tools" links to target "rclcpp_components::component" but the
  target was not found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an
  IMPORTED target, or an ALIAS target is missing?


CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    USE_PANGOLIN_VIEWER


CMake Generate step failed.  Build files cannot be regenerated correctly.
